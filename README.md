\`img\` is a demo application that has been created to showcase Atomic Assets. An Atomic Asset is
a Tradeable PST, that can be STAMPed. The \`STAMP\` process gives viewers the ability to create a proof of 
attention. And by making the data tradeable, it allows the community to share in the rewards.
